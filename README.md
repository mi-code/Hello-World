  Good Morning, I hope you have a great day.

I see Xiaomi has released the source kernel for Redmi pad (Yunluo), I think this is the annoying thing Xiaomi does, we can easily analogize it.

It is known that:
- Redmi pad was released on October 05, 2022 and the source kernel was released on January 11, 2023. This means that Xiaomi only needs at least 3-4 months after the device hits the global market to release the source kernel.
- Redmi note 11 was released on February 09, 2022 and the source kernel was not released until January 12, 2023. Xiaomi has not released the source kernel for the device for almost a year.

The question is:
- Does Xiaomi still care about its open source?
- Does Xiaomi not care about the redmi note 11 source kernel which has not been released for almost a year?
- Does Xiaomi have a plan when their source kernel for the redmi note 11 can be released soon?
